# ZCorp-All-Files-1617

This is ZPrograms / ZCorp files from 2016/2017. 
Also contains the final build before the shutdown in May of 2017.

Some things you will not find in this:

* A full compiled version of a 2016 release (sorry, I do not have any of them, they are long gone...) [This is basically any ZMessages build (before zcorp/zprograms)
* Anything that has been changed/added/removed in builds from 2019 and forward. None of that has been put in there.
* Some things that we still need to keep on the down low. We don't wanna reveal some things still. Maybe in the future there will be a chunk 6. (This isn't much though)


Some things you may find but aren't really apart of the ZPrograms files:

* Some school files. Remember, I used this build I have for school back in the day. I don't think I deleted much of it, because there was so much. So I might have some OLD personal files in there.
* Some files that have nothing to do with the program, but I was too lazy to fully review before adding it to these chunks. Yeah... I am lazy. lol


Thanks for reading. Enjoy the files.
